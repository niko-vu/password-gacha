# Password Gacha

## Description

While reaching the final product of this project, I found that I was motivated by the fact that this was my first JavaScript-oriented project. At the moment, I do not have a strong grasp on JavaScript. I'm not well-versed with its syntax, structure, etc. BUT, because of my lack of experience and applied knowledge, I wanted so badly to be able to execute this challenge successfully.

I continued to build upon the existing JavaScript file until completion because I wanted to see how I could make the site functional; I wanted to see how I could do this on my own with the help of research; and I wanted to learn through the process of doing.

I solved so many problems doing this challenge--from my lack of knowing where to even start, to me not knowing how to make the password show up in the output box.

I learned how to turn a static website into a functioning and interactive one. I was able to figure out how to use the return function, how to randomly generate characters, and I solidified my ability to write conditional statements.

## Usage

In order to use this application, one must press the "Generate Password" button and enter in their own answers for the prompted questions regarding password requirements. An assortment of answer combinations may be inputted and given a secure and randomized password. Those using the application can also inspect element and open the console to see the interactive elements in a more transparent and direct way.

The deployed application should look something like this:

## Credits

* I referenced this [Professional README Guide tutorial](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) for the structure of my README.

* I did not author the starter code and I cloned it from the repository, [friendly-parakeet](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet). This code can be found in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I only edited the HTML file by linking the CSS and JavaScript file properly and I added a lot of code to the JavaScript file to add functionality to the Generate Password button. 

* I referenced the examples on this [MDN Web Docs Window: prompt() method page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) in order to add my own pop-up prompt windows to the site.

* I also heavily referenced this [GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-generate-a-random-password-using-javascript/#) on how to generate a random password using JavaScript.
